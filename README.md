Just finished Udacity's AJAX course.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around AJAX and trying to break down each bit of code
to understand exerything that's going on.  I do however see why AJAX is so widely used.  Pretty cool stuff.
I removed my NYTIMES api key so that piece of the app doesn't work, but the google streetview and wikipedia api work just fine.
